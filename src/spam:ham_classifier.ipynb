    "In this project, you will use what you've learned in class to create a classifier that can distinguish spam (junk or commercial or bulk) emails from ham (non-spam) emails. In addition to providing some skeleton code to fill in, we will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and your written responses in this notebook.\n",

I find that the ability to generalize is more in the logistic regression classifier and not at all in the 0 predictor because the 0 predictor is very specific to that particular data set, but the logistic regression classifier is more useful for all new unseen data sets."

    "With this in mind, it is now your task to make the spam filter more accurate. In order to get full credit on the accuracy part of this assignment, you must get at least **88%** accuracy on the test set. To see your accuracy on the test set, you will use your classifier to predict every email in the `test` DataFrame and upload your predictions to Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kaggle limits you to four submissions per day**. This means you should start early so you have time if needed to refine your model. You will be able to see your accuracy on the entire set when submitting to Kaggle (the accuracy that will determine your score for question 10).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some ideas for improving your model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Finding better features based on the email text. Some example features are:\n",
    "    1. Number of characters in the subject / body\n",
    "    1. Number of words in the subject / body\n",
    "    1. Use of punctuation (e.g., how many '!' were there?)\n",
    "    1. Number / percentage of capital letters \n",
    "    1. Whether the email is a reply to an earlier email or a forwarded email\n",
    "1. Finding better words to use as features. Which words are the best at distinguishing emails? This requires digging into the email text itself. \n",
    "1. Better data processing. For example, many emails contain HTML as well as text. You can consider extracting out the text from the HTML to help you find better words. Or, you can match HTML tags themselves, or even some combination of the two.\n",
    "1. Model selection. You can adjust parameters of your model (e.g. the regularization parameter) to achieve higher accuracy. Recall that you should use cross-validation to do feature and model selection properly! Otherwise, you will likely overfit to your training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "ou may use whatever method you prefer in order to create features, but **you are not allowed to import any external feature extraction libraries**. In addition, **you are only allowed to train logistic regression models**. No random forests, k-nearest-neighbors, neural nets, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have not provided any code to do this, so feel free to create as many cells as you need in order to tackle this task. However, answering questions 7, 8, and 9 should help guide you.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** *You should use the **validation data** to evaluate your model and get a better sense of how it will perform on the Kaggle evaluation.*\n",

    "(1) The way I thought of my model was my searching for words that are seen mostly in spam emails and using those as features and then using words that were in ham emails and then using them as identifiers for the ham emails. In addition to adding features/words, I decided to add another feature that takes into account the length of each email since I found that spam tends to be longer and also using a lot of unprofessionality amongst its emails. In the spam emails they used a much larger amount of exclamation marks and other punctuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) What didn't work for me was trying to better the accuracy by using more and more key words. That definitely helped me get a few percentage higher, but only to a certain point. After that, I had to take into account other features such as length of emails, punctuation and more. What I found that really worked was the other features and what didn't was the words after a certain extent. I don't mean to discount key words at all because they got us 70-80%+ accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) What I found really surprising was how slowly the classifiers accuracy improved. Its incremental increases were very slight. I wanted to get increases in my classifier that were significant and actually made a difference in increasing my accuracy. I found that trying to optimize just words only does so much, and so I learned that I had to diversify my features and so I incorporated more features than just words. The more the merrier!"

    "### Question 9: Precision-Recall Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "We can trade off between precision and recall. In most cases we won't be able to get both perfect precision (i.e. no false positives) and recall (i.e. no false negatives), so we have to compromise. For example, in the case of cancer screenings, false negatives are comparatively worse than false positives — a false negative means that a patient might not discover a disease until it's too late to treat, while a false positive means that a patient will probably have to take another screening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that logistic regression calculates the probability that an example belongs to a certain class. Then, to classify an example we say that an email is spam if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.5$ probability of being spam. However, *we can adjust that cutoff*: we can say that an email is spam only if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.7$ probability of being spam, for example. This is how we can trade off false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The precision-recall curve shows this trade off for each possible cutoff probability. In the cell below, [plot a precision-recall curve](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_precision_recall.html#plot-the-precision-recall-curve) for your final classifier (the one you use to make predictions for Kaggle).\n",
