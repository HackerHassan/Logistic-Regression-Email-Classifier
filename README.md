# Logistic-Regression-Email-Classifier
Built a classifier that can distinguish spam (junk or commercial or bulk) emails from ham (non-spam) emails.

## What I learned from this project:
- Feature engineering with text data
- Using sklearn libraries to process data and fit models
- Validating the performance of your model and minimizing overfitting
- Generating and analyzing precision-recall curves
